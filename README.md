# UTH-Mutation-Project
# The purpose of this file is to provide code that was used to detail the steps in finding potential binding factors within motifs. The file will go step by step starting with how the data was obtained to the various commands used to sort information. This file will be continually updated as the project includes further analysis commands.

# The first step was to find the files that are needed for the project. One the first files to obtain is the motif matches file. This file can be obtained by following this link: http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/ and downloading the matches.txt.gz. The following link will directly download the text file  http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/matches.txt.gz The second file to obtain are the non-coding variants for possible mutation sites. The file was found in COSMIC, also known as the  Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer. Going to the data tab and then selecting downloads will provide various datasets that can be used. For the purposes of this project, the file that will be used is the non coding variants. One note before this file can be obtained is to create a COSMIC account to be able to download any of their files.
